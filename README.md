# MCUNet for Acoustic Species Audio Classification

To get started, download the Visual Wake Words dataset for testing purposes from the Han Lab's pre-built minival set from here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/bc7qi89ezra9711/vww-minival.tar?dl=0), around 380MB.

Place the ```vww-minival``` folder (uncompressed) into the ```./data``` directory for use with the commands given below:

- To evaluate the PyTorch models quantized with fp32, run the following:

```python ./eval_torch.py --net_id=mcunet-vww2 --dataset=vww --data-dir=./data/vww-minival/dataset/vww-s256```

- To evaluate the TF-Lite models quantized with int8, run the following: 

```python ./eval_tflite.py --net_id=mcunet-vww2 --dataset=vww --data-dir=./data/vww-minival/dataset/vww-s256```

Below is the README for the original MCUNet repo that this repo forks, directly from the MIT Han Lab.

## Overview

Microcontrollers are low-cost, low-power hardware. They are widely deployed and have wide applications.

![teaser](assets/figures/applications.png)

But the tight memory budget (50,000x smaller than GPUs) makes deep learning deployment difficult.

![teaser](assets/figures/memory_size.png)

MCUNet is a **system-algorithm co-design** framework for tiny deep learning on microcontrollers. It consists of **TinyNAS** and **TinyEngine**. They are co-designed to fit the tight memory budgets.

With system-algorithm co-design, we can significantly improve the deep learning performance on the same tiny memory budget.

![teaser](assets/figures/overview.png)

Our **TinyEngine** inference engine could be a useful infrastructure for MCU-based AI applications. It significantly **improves the inference speed and reduces the memory usage** compared to existing libraries like [TF-Lite Micro](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/microcontrollers), [CMSIS-NN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06601), [MicroTVM](https://tvm.apache.org/2020/06/04/tinyml-how-tvm-is-taming-tiny), etc. It improves the inference speed by **1.5-3x**, and reduces the peak memory by **2.7-4.8x**.

## Model Zoo

### Usage

You can build the pre-trained PyTorch `fp32` model or the `int8` quantized model in TF-Lite format.

```python
from mcunet.model_zoo import net_id_list, build_model, download_tflite
print(net_id_list)  # the list of models in the model zoo

# pytorch fp32 model
model, image_size, description = build_model(net_id="mcunet-in3", pretrained=True)  # you can replace net_id with any other option from net_id_list

# download tflite file to tflite_path
tflite_path = download_tflite(net_id="mcunet-in3")
```


### Evaluate

To evaluate the accuracy of PyTorch `fp32` models, run:

```bash
python eval_torch.py --net_id mcunet-in2 --dataset {imagenet/vww} --data-dir PATH/TO/DATA/val
```

To evaluate the accuracy of TF-Lite `int8` models, run:

```bash
python eval_tflite.py --net_id mcunet-in2 --dataset {imagenet/vww} --data-dir PATH/TO/DATA/val
```

### Model List

- Note that all the **latency**, **SRAM**, and **Flash** usage are profiled with **TinyEngine** on STM32F746.
- Here we only provide the `int8` quantized modes. `int4` quantized models (as shown in the paper) can further push the accuracy-memory trade-off, but lacking a general format support.
- For accuracy (top1, top-5), we report the accuracy of `fp32`/`int8` models respectively

The **ImageNet** model list:

The **VWW** model list:

*Note that the VWW dataset might be hard to prepare. You can download our pre-built `minival` set from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bc7qi89ezra9711/vww-minival.tar?dl=0), around 380MB.*

| net_id      | MACs  | #Params | SRAM  | Flash | Resolution | Top-1<br />(fp32/int8) |
| ----------- | ----- | ------- | ----- | ----- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| mcunet-vww0 | 6.0M  | 0.37M   | 146kB | 617kB | 64         | 87.4%/87.3%            |
| mcunet-vww1 | 11.6M | 0.43M   | 162kB | 689kB | 80         | 88.9%/88.9%            |
| mcunet-vww2 | 55.8M | 0.64M   | 311kB | 897kB | 144        | 91.7%/91.8%            |

For TF-Lite `int8` models, we do not use quantization-aware training (QAT), so some results is slightly lower than paper numbers. 

### Detection Model

We also share the person detection model used in the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4XKn0iDfxg). To visualize the model's prediction on a sample image, please run the following command:

```bash
python eval_det.py
```

It will visualize the prediction here: `assets/sample_images/person_det_vis.jpg`.

The model takes in a small input resolution of 128x160 to reduce memory usage. It does not achieve state-of-the-art performance due to the limited image and model size but should provide decent performance for tinyML applications (please check the demo for a video recording). We will also release the deployment code in the upcoming TinyEngine release. 

## Requirement

- Python 3.6+

- PyTorch 1.4.0+

- Tensorflow 1.15 (if you want to test TF-Lite models; CPU support only)
